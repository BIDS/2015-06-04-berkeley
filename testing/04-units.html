<p>Unit tests are so called because they exercise the functionality of the code by interrogating individual functions and methods. Fuctions and methods can often be considered the atomic units of software because they are indivisble. However, what is considered to be the smallest code <em>unit</em> is subjective. The body of a function can be long are short, and shorter functions are arguably more unit-like than long ones.</p>
<p>Thus what reasonably constitutes a code unit typically varies from project to project and language to language. A good guideline is that if the code cannot be made any simpler logically (you cannot split apart the addition operator) or practically (a function is self-contained and well defined), then it is a unit.</p>

<h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin"></span>Functions are Like Paragraphs</h2>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>Recall that humans can only hold a few ideas in our heads at once. Paragraphs in books, for example, become unwieldy after a few lines. Functions, generaly, shouldn’t be longer than paragraphs. Robert C. Martin, the author of “Clean Code” said : “The first rule of functions is that <em>they should be small</em>. The second rule of functions is that <em>they should be smaller than that</em>.”</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p>The desire to unit test code often has the effect of encouraging both the code and the tests to be as small, well-defined, and modular as possible.<br />In Python, unit tests typically take the form of test functions that call and make assertions about methods and functions in the code base. To run these test functions, a test framework is often required to collect them together. For now, we’ll write some tests for the mean function and simply run them individually to see whether they fail. In the next session, we’ll use a test framework to collect and run them.</p>
<p>Unit tests are typically made of three pieces, some set-up, a number of assertions, and some tear-down. Set-up can be as simple as initializing the input values or as complex as creating and initializing concrete instances of a class. Ultimately, the test occurs when an assertion is made, comparing the observed and expected values.</p>

<p>The above example didn’t require much setup or teardown. Consider, however, the following example that could arise when comunicating with third-party programs. You have a function <code>f()</code> which will write a file named <code>yes.txt</code> to disk with the value 42 but only if a file <code>no.txt</code> does not exist. To truly test the function works, you would want to ensure that neither <code>yes.txt</code> nor <code>no.txt</code> existed before you ran your test. After the test, you want to clean up after yourself before the next test comes along. You could write the test, setup, and teardown functions as follows:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="ch">import</span> os

<span class="ch">from</span> nose.tools <span class="ch">import</span> assert_equal, with_setup

<span class="ch">from</span> mod <span class="ch">import</span> f

<span class="kw">def</span> f_setup():
    <span class="co"># The f_setup() function tests ensure that neither the yes.txt nor the</span>
    <span class="co"># no.txt files exist.</span>
    files = os.listdir(<span class="st">&#39;.&#39;</span>)
    <span class="kw">if</span> <span class="st">&#39;no.txt&#39;</span> in files:
        os.remove(<span class="st">&#39;no.txt&#39;</span>)
    <span class="kw">if</span> <span class="st">&#39;yes.txt&#39;</span> in files:
        os.remove(<span class="st">&#39;yes.txt&#39;</span>)

<span class="kw">def</span> f_teardown():
    <span class="co"># The f_teardown() function removes the yes.txt file, if it was created.</span>
    files = os.listdir(<span class="st">&#39;.&#39;</span>)
    <span class="kw">if</span> <span class="st">&#39;yes.txt&#39;</span> in files:
        os.remove(<span class="st">&#39;yes.txt&#39;</span>)

<span class="kw">def</span> test_f():
    <span class="co"># The first action of test_f() is to make sure the file system is clean.</span>
    f_setup()
    exp = <span class="dv">42</span>
    f()
    <span class="kw">with</span> <span class="dt">open</span>(<span class="st">&#39;yes.txt&#39;</span>, <span class="st">&#39;r&#39;</span>) <span class="ch">as</span> fhandle:
        obs = <span class="dt">int</span>(fhandle.read())
    assert_equal(exp, obd)
    <span class="co"># The last action of test_f() is to clean up after itself.</span>
    f_teardown()</code></pre>
<p>The above implementation of setup and teardown is usually fine.<br />However, it does not guarantee that the <code>f_setup()</code> and the <code>f_teardown()</code> functions will be called. This is becaue an unexpected error anywhere in the body of <code>f()</code> or <code>test_f()</code> will cause the test to abort before the teardown function is reached.</p>
<p>These setup and teardown behaviors are needed when <em>test fixtures</em> must be created. A fixture is any environmental state or object that is required for the test to successfully run.</p>
<p>As above, a function that is executed before the test to prepare the fixture is called a <em>setup</em> function. One that is executed to mop-up side effects after a test is run is called a <em>teardown</em> function. Nose has a decorator that you can use to automatically run setup and teardown of fixtures no matter if the test succeeded, failed, or had an error.</p>
<p>To make sure that both of the functions will be executed, you must use nose’s <code>with_setup()</code> decorator. This decorator may be applied to any test and takes a setup and a teardown function as possible arguments. We can rewrite the <code>test_f()</code> to be wrapped by <code>with_setup()</code>.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="ot">@with_setup</span>(setup=f_setup, teardown=f_teardown)
<span class="kw">def</span> test_f():
    exp = <span class="dv">42</span>
    f()
    <span class="kw">with</span> <span class="dt">open</span>(<span class="st">&#39;yes.txt&#39;</span>, <span class="st">&#39;r&#39;</span>) <span class="ch">as</span> fhandle:
        obs = <span class="dt">int</span>(fhandle.read())
    assert_equal(exp, obd)</code></pre>
<p>Note that if you have functions in your test module that are simply named <code>setup()</code> and <code>teardown()</code>, each of these are called automatically when the entire test module is loaded in and finished.</p>
